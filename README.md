# persistent-bookmarks package

Similar to https://atom.io/packages/bookmarks but bookmarks remain after you close a text editor, and even after closing a project.

Bookmarks are ordered by time of creation.

## Default Shortcuts
`ctrl-alt-b`: Toggle bookmark

`ctrl-alt-m`: View all bookmarks

`ctrl-alt-shift-m`: Clear all bookmarks
